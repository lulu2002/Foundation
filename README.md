### Foundation is a library for bootstrapping Minecraft plugins.

Thousands of servers are running on Foundation since 2013. It has been battle tested and proven in plugins ChatControl, Boss, CoreArena, Confiscate, AutoPlay, Puncher, Winter, AnimeX and others.

Foundation has never been publicly released before MineAcademy. We decided to release its sources to the public and teach it to enable people develop plugins faster, saving boilerplate code and thus focus on what matters the most, putting their ideas out there.

### Import using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
Make sure to have the following repository added to your pom.xml file
```XML
<repository>
    <id>mineacademy-repo</id>
    <url>https://repo.mineacademy.org/repository/maven-public/</url>
</repository>
```
You will also need to add foundation as a dependency. Replace VERSION with the
latest version listed [here](https://git.mineacademy.org/libraries/foundation/-/releases)
```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mineacademy.libraries</groupId>
