We primarly use Eclipse with a couple of adjustments to code and service Foundation. You can use whatever IDE suits you as long as you follow our existing guideliness.

### Codestyle in Eclipse

Following our codestyle in Eclipse is very easy, simply download and install our preferences, clean up profile and formatter profile from this link:

### Codestyle in IntelliJ

IntellIj needs some adjustments, unfortunately at this time I am not able to compile a list but here is a great plugin that enables your code to look much the same like for Eclipse:

Also make sure that the imports do not contain "*" and single method return statements are not folded.
